"""Checks that the committed status page still matches the registers.

**A diff would have been the obvious check and it does not work.** The status
page stamps the commit it was generated from and the minute it was generated, so
regenerating it and running `git diff --exit-code` reports a change on every run
whatever the registers say. The first version of the CI workflow did exactly
that and would have failed permanently.

So this compares the *numbers* instead. They are the reason the page exists, and
they are what goes stale when somebody edits a register and forgets to
regenerate. The timestamp going stale is not interesting; the count of
discharged conditions going stale is the thing CLAUDE.md added `conditions.py`
to prevent.

Exits non-zero with the mismatch named. Run from the repository root.
